### *Hello, there! I'm Pedro.*
> ″*Code is not like other how-computers-work books. It doesn’t have big color illustrations of disk drives with arrows showing how the data sweeps into the computer. Code has no drawings of trains carrying a cargo of zeros and ones. Metaphors and similes are wonderful literary devices but they do nothing but obscure the beauty of technology.*″
 — Charles Petzold, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software
